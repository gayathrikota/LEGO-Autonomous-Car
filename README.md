LEGO Autonomous Car
Overview
The LEGO Autonomous Car project demonstrates the integration of robotics and autonomous vehicle technologies using LEGO Mindstorms. The project aims to provide a real-time, self-driving vehicle solution capable of navigating a predefined path while avoiding obstacles, specifically designed for assisting individuals with disabilities.

Features
Self-Driving Vehicle: Uses ultrasonic sensors to navigate a predefined path and avoid obstacles in real time.

Automatic Door Opening: The vehicle includes an automatic door-opening feature to provide easy access for users.

Wheelchair Accessibility: The car features a sliding mechanism to allow easy entry for individuals using a wheelchair, ensuring that the vehicle accommodates people with mobility challenges.

Wireless Control: The vehicle can be controlled remotely, allowing operators to manage the car from a distance.

Technologies Used
LEGO Mindstorms: For building the vehicle and integrating sensors and motors.

Ultrasonic Sensors: For obstacle detection and navigation.

Motors & Servos: For movement and door-opening functionalities.

Installation
Prerequisites
LEGO Mindstorms EV3 kit

LEGO Mindstorms software (for programming the robot)

Setup
Build the LEGO vehicle according to the provided instructions or design a custom version.

Use LEGO Mindstorms software to program the vehicle with the necessary autonomous and control features.

Test the vehicleâ€™s sensors to ensure they function correctly for obstacle detection and path navigation.

How It Works
The vehicle uses ultrasonic sensors to measure the distance between itself and obstacles, navigating accordingly to avoid collisions. The automatic door opens when the vehicle senses proximity to a user, allowing easy entry. The sliding mechanism on the vehicle ensures that a wheelchair can be easily rolled into the car.
